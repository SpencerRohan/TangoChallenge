## Tango Code Challenge


To install & setup:
 * Clone: ```git clone git@github.com:SpencerRohan/TangoChallenge.git```
 * NPM: ```npm install```
 * Run test by typing ```npm test``` or ```mocha test```
 * You may read the code challenge [here](https://github.com/SpencerRohan/TangoChallenge/blob/master/AssignmentOverview.pdf)

---
Notes:

  * I took this challenge as an opportunity to learn mocha and chai testing suites.
  * You can find all the test scripts in the ```test/*.js``` files.
  * If you wish to embed all the code for each assignment files, utilizing ```app.js``` would be the way to go.
  * Each assignment is located in seperate files in the root directory. The scripts have been exported in a module, something that I also wanted to play with for this challenge.

Assignment 1: 
 * The second solution to assignment 1 is faster to compute(I tested against a benchmark library), however I from a OOD stand-point it is my opinion that it is a cleaner solution - with the ability to scale up.
---

Assignment 2:
 * The solve for assignment 2 was fun.  I think there were a few ways I could have approached this solution - but I found it very effective to just grab the points needed by reordering the data given, and compare the values.
--- 
 
Assignment 3: 
 * This assignment took me the longest, to think of how to approach the problem.  Once I took a moment to asses the situation after a brute force attempt - the solution came very quickly.

My Info:

Feel free to reach out if you have any follow up questions or concerns. I'm happy to talk more about my code! I would love any feedback or code suggestions, I am always on the hunt for better solutions to my developing techniques. Thank you for your time!
